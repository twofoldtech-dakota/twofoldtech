## STUDIO Is Now Open Source

STUDIO—our agentic orchestration platform—is now open source. Teams can inspect, extend, and adopt deterministic orchestration without waiting on a closed platform.

## What is STUDIO?

STUDIO is an AI-powered development platform that uses a Tri-Agent Architecture to build enterprise software. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that generate code without context, STUDIO:

- **Plans before building**: Creates execution-ready plans validated against your architecture
- **Validates continuously**: Runs tests and checks at every step
- **Self-corrects**: Automatically fixes issues without human intervention
- **Maintains integrity**: Ensures code adheres to your standards

## What's New

### Memory System

STUDIO now includes a persistent memory system that learns your preferences:

```
studio/memory/
├── global.md      # Always-applied rules
├── frontend.md    # Frontend-specific rules
├── backend.md     # Backend-specific rules
└── testing.md     # Testing requirements
```

Rules in memory are automatically embedded in every plan.

### Quality Gate

Every build now ends with a quality gate—a series of checks that determine whether the build meets your standards:

- **STRONG**: All checks pass
- **SOUND**: Required checks pass, optional warnings
- **BLOCKED**: Required check failed, fixes needed

### Interactive Mode

Interactive mode lets you approve each step before execution:

```bash
/build:interactive "Add user authentication"
```

## Getting Started

1. **Use the open-source version** and adapt it to your workflows
2. **Request hosted beta access** at [twofold.tech/contact](/contact)
3. **Initialize your project** with `studio init`
4. **Start building** with `/build "your task"`
