## Introduction

Migrating from Sitecore XP to XM Cloud isn't just a platform upgrade—it's an architectural transformation. This guide covers the key considerations and strategies for a successful migration.

## Understanding the Shift

### From Monolith to Composable

Sitecore XP is a monolithic platform where content management, delivery, and personalization are tightly coupled. XM Cloud separates these concerns:

```
SITECORE XP (Monolith)
├── Content Management
├── Content Delivery
├── xDB Analytics
├── Personalization
└── Marketing Automation

XM CLOUD (Composable)
├── Content Management (XM Cloud)
├── Content Delivery (Edge/CDN)
├── Analytics (Sitecore CDP or third-party)
├── Personalization (Sitecore Personalize)
└── Marketing (Sitecore Send or third-party)
```

### From .NET Rendering to Headless

XM Cloud requires a headless front-end. Your rendering logic moves from Razor views to a JavaScript framework:

- **Next.js** (recommended by Sitecore)
- **Astro** (for static-heavy sites)
- **Remix** (for dynamic applications)

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Assessment

Before migrating, audit your current implementation:

1. **Content inventory**: How many items? What templates?
2. **Custom code audit**: What pipelines and processors exist?
3. **Integration mapping**: What systems connect to Sitecore?
4. **Personalization rules**: What rules need to migrate to CDP?

### Phase 2: Content Architecture

XM Cloud uses a different content structure. Key changes:

- **Headless SXA**: Sites are configured differently
- **Component mapping**: Renderings become JSON-based components
- **Media handling**: Media library items need CDN configuration

### Phase 3: Data Migration

This is where a deterministic migration pipeline matters. A typical workflow:

```bash
# Extract content from XP
content-export --source ./master.db --output ./content

# Transform to XM Cloud format
content-transform --input ./content --mapping ./template-map.json

# Validate and import
content-validate --input ./content --schema xmcloud
content-import --target xmcloud --project your-project
```

### Phase 4: Front-End Development

Build your headless front-end:

1. Set up Next.js with Sitecore JSS
2. Create component mappings
3. Implement layout service integration
4. Configure preview and editing modes

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization

- **Content verification**: Ensure all content migrated correctly
- **Link validation**: Check internal links and media references
- **Performance testing**: Validate Core Web Vitals
- **SEO audit**: Confirm meta tags and structured data

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Underestimating Custom Code

XP customizations don't migrate automatically. Audit every:
- Pipeline processor
- Event handler
- Custom field type
- Computed field

### 2. Ignoring Media Optimization

XM Cloud uses Sitecore's media CDN. Large media libraries need:
- Image optimization
- Responsive image configuration
- CDN cache warming

### 3. Rushing Personalization

Don't try to migrate all personalization rules at once. Start with:
- Top 10 highest-impact rules
- Rules with clear business value
- Rules that can be measured

## Conclusion

XM Cloud migration is a significant undertaking, but the benefits—modern architecture, better performance, reduced infrastructure burden—make it worthwhile.
