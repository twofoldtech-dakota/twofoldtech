mission: >
  Unify enterprise content systems and deliver deterministic, auditable

  contrast: "Prompt-and-Pray"
  statement: >
    While the industry races toward AI-generated output with no guardrails,
    we focus on Deterministic Orchestration—ensuring agentic intelligence
    follows strict, senior-level architectural logic. AI should be traceable,
    auditable, and architecturally sound.

values:
  - name: Senior-Level Standards
    description: >
      We don't hand off to juniors. The people you talk to are the people
      who do the work. Dakota and Dillon lead every engagement personally.

  - name: Deterministic Over Probabilistic
    description: >
      AI should follow architectural logic, not hunches. Every decision
      is traceable. Every output is auditable. No black boxes.

  - name: Products Over Promises
    description: >
      We ship software, not slide decks. Our products (Conduit, STUDIO)
      encode our expertise into tools that enterprises and agencies use.

  - name: Scale Without the Bench
    description: >
      We're not carrying a bench that needs to stay billable. For larger
      engagements, we bring in vetted specialists we've worked with for years.
      We scale to fit the work, not the other way around.

positioning:
  statement: >
    Twofold Tech is not an agency. We're two senior engineers—brothers—with
    30 combined years in enterprise software. We advise on architecture,
    engineering leadership, and AI integration. And we build products that
    unify CMS context (Conduit) and orchestrate deterministic delivery (STUDIO).

  differentiator: >
    You'll never be handed off to someone you didn't hire. We lead every
    engagement personally. When projects require additional capacity, we
    bring in vetted specialists we've worked with for years—but we stay
    accountable.

  market_position: >
    We operate alongside and above agencies—not in competition with them.
    We're the senior expertise agencies call when they're stuck, and we
    build the tools they wish they had: unified CMS access and deterministic
    orchestration.

  combined_expertise:
    - Enterprise CMS (Sitecore XP/XM Cloud, Contentful, Umbraco, Optimizely)
    - CMS unification & integration (MCP, adapter architecture, governance)
    - AI & Agentic orchestration (deterministic, auditable, enterprise-grade)
    - Fortune 500 and federal government scale operations
    - Compliance & security (DevSecOps, WCAG, regulatory)
