# TWOFOLD TECH - Manifesto
# Version: 3.0
# Last Updated: 2026-02-04

title: "Senior Expertise. Serious Software."

preamble: >
  Enterprise software has a context problem. Teams are split across multiple
  CMS platforms, integration glue is brittle, and AI tools generate output
  without accountability. Someone has to actually know what they're doing—and
  make systems deterministic.

declaration: >
  We're Dakota and Dillon Smith—two brothers with 30 combined years in enterprise
  software. We advise on architecture, engineering leadership, and AI integration.
  And we build products that enterprises and agencies actually use.

positioning: >
  We're not an agency. We don't carry a bench of juniors waiting to be billable.
  The people you talk to are the people who do the work. We bring senior-level
  expertise to complex problems—through direct advisory and products that encode
  what we've learned.

pillars:

  - name: Senior Expertise
    principle: "The people you hire should be the people who do the work."
    statement: >
      We lead every engagement personally. Architecture reviews, technical strategy,
      engineering leadership guidance—delivered directly by practitioners with
      15+ years of experience each. No bait-and-switch. No handoff to juniors.

  - name: Systems That Ship
    principle: "We build software, not slide decks."
    statement: >
      Conduit is our enterprise MCP server—one connection to every CMS. STUDIO is
      our open-source orchestration platform—Deterministic Orchestration that
      ensures AI follows senior-level architectural logic. These aren't concepts.
      They're production-grade systems that teams use.

  - name: Accountable Advisory
    principle: "We stay responsible for what we recommend."
    statement: >
      Advisory without accountability is just opinion. When we advise on
      architecture or AI integration, we're prepared to help build it.
      When projects require additional capacity, we bring in vetted specialists
      we've worked with for years—but we stay accountable.

closing: >
  We operate alongside and above agencies—not in competition with them. We're
  the senior expertise agencies call when they're stuck, and we build the tools
  they wish they had. You'll never be handed off to someone you didn't hire.

thesis:
  name: Deterministic Orchestration
  contrast: Prompt-and-Pray
  statement: >
    While the industry races toward AI-generated output with no guardrails,
    we focus on Deterministic Orchestration—ensuring agentic intelligence
    follows strict, senior-level architectural logic. AI should be traceable,
    auditable, and architecturally sound.

  SENIOR EXPERTISE. SERIOUS SOFTWARE.

  Enterprise software has a context problem. Teams are split across multiple
  CMS platforms, integration glue is brittle, and AI tools generate output
  without accountability. Someone has to actually know what they're doing—and
  make systems deterministic.

  We're Dakota and Dillon Smith—two brothers with 30 combined years in enterprise
  software. We advise on architecture, engineering leadership, and AI integration.
  And we build products that enterprises and agencies actually use.

  We're not an agency. We don't carry a bench of juniors waiting to be billable.
  The people you talk to are the people who do the work. We bring senior-level
  expertise to complex problems—through direct advisory and products that encode
  what we've learned.

  SENIOR EXPERTISE
  The people you hire should be the people who do the work. We lead every
  engagement personally. Architecture reviews, technical strategy, engineering
  leadership guidance—delivered directly by practitioners with 15+ years of
  experience each. No bait-and-switch. No handoff to juniors.

  SYSTEMS THAT SHIP
  We build software, not slide decks. Conduit is our enterprise MCP server—one
  connection to every CMS. STUDIO is our open-source orchestration platform—
  Deterministic Orchestration that ensures AI follows senior-level architectural
  logic. These aren't concepts. They're production-grade systems that teams use.

  ACCOUNTABLE ADVISORY
  We stay responsible for what we recommend. Advisory without accountability
  is just opinion. When we advise on architecture or AI integration, we're
  prepared to help build it. When projects require additional capacity, we
  bring in vetted specialists we've worked with for years—but we stay accountable.

  We operate alongside and above agencies—not in competition with them. We're
  the senior expertise agencies call when they're stuck, and we build the tools
  they wish they had. You'll never be handed off to someone you didn't hire.
