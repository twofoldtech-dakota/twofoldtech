principles:

      Position Dakota and Dillon's combined 30 years of experience upfront.
      Credibility comes from track record, not marketing claims.

  - name: Write for decision-makers
    description: >
      Assume technical competence. Don't over-explain fundamentals.
      Respect the reader's expertise while demonstrating yours.

  - name: Favor the concrete
    description: >
      Replace abstractions with examples. Show system behavior,
      not just capabilities. Reference real products (STUDIO, ALLOY).

  - name: Be personally accountable
    description: >
      Use "we" to mean Dakota and Dillon specifically, not a faceless company.
      Emphasize direct engagement and personal responsibility.

  - name: Maintain technical gravity
    description: >
      Content should feel weighty and substantive.
      Avoid filler and marketing fluff.

examples:
  good:
    - "You'll work directly with Dakota and Dillon—the same people who architect and build your system."
    - "STUDIO traces every AI-generated change to its originating requirement."
    - "We've spent 30 combined years solving these exact problems in enterprise environments."
    - "When projects need additional capacity, we bring in specialists we've worked with for years—but we stay accountable."

  bad:
    - "Our revolutionary platform will transform your development workflow!"
    - "Leverage next-gen AI to supercharge your team's productivity."
    - "Our team of resources is standing by to help."
    - "We're a research lab focused on innovation."
