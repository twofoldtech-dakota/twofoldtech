objections:

  - objection: "We already use Copilot/ChatGPT for code generation."
    category: Competition
    response: >
      Consumer AI tools generate code without verification. STUDIO adds
      the traceability and correctness layer that enterprise systems require.
      AI builds the code—STUDIO ensures it's correct.
    proof_points:
      - Requirements-to-implementation traceability
      - Plan-first workflow prevents architectural drift
      - Deterministic rollback capabilities

  - objection: "We'll build our own orchestration layer."
    category: Build vs. Buy
    response: >
      Building production-grade orchestration takes 12-18 months of dedicated
      engineering. STUDIO provides that foundation immediately, with open-box
      architecture you can customize and extend.
    proof_points:
      - Open-box architecture for customization
      - Documented extension points
      - Focus your team on domain-specific logic

  - objection: "How is this different from other AI dev tools?"
    category: Differentiation
    response: >
      Most AI tools focus on generation speed. STUDIO focuses on correctness.
      We trace every change to its requirement, enforce quality gates, and
      provide deterministic rollback. Generation without verification is
      technical debt at scale.
    proof_points:
      - Plan-then-build workflow
      - Quality gates before execution
      - Full audit trail

  - objection: "This seems like research, not production-ready software."
    category: Maturity
    response: >
      Our products emerge from research but ship as production-grade tooling.
      ALLOY powers high-concurrency modernization in production environments.
      STUDIO is used for enterprise development workflows.
    proof_points:
      - Production deployments
      - Enterprise customer references
      - Performance benchmarks

  - objection: "We're not ready for this level of change."
    category: Timing
    response: >
      STUDIO integrates with existing workflows—it doesn't replace them.
      Start with a single team or project. The plan-first approach reduces
      risk, not increases it.
    proof_points:
      - Incremental adoption path
      - Existing toolchain integration
      - Rollback capabilities for safety

positioning_against:

  - competitor: "Consumer AI Tools (Copilot, ChatGPT)"
    our_advantage: >
      Verification and traceability. Consumer tools generate without
      validating correctness or maintaining audit trails.
    their_strength: >
      Ubiquitous, low barrier to entry, familiar interface.
    counter: >
      Familiarity without correctness creates technical debt at scale.

  - competitor: "No-Code/Low-Code Platforms"
    our_advantage: >
      Full code ownership and visibility. No platform lock-in.
      Industrial-grade performance characteristics.
    their_strength: >
      Fast prototyping, lower technical barrier.
    counter: >
      Enterprise systems require inspectable, auditable code—not
      proprietary abstractions.
