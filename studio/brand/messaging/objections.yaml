  # === Advisory/Team Size ===

  - objection: "You're just two people—can you handle enterprise scale?"
    category: Team Size
    response: >
      We've each spent 15+ years delivering enterprise projects at Fortune 500
      and federal government scale. When engagements require additional capacity,
      we bring in vetted specialists we've worked with for years—but we stay
      accountable. You're not hiring a bench; you're hiring senior expertise
      that scales to fit the work.
    proof_points:
      - Combined 30 years enterprise experience
      - Fortune 500 and federal government track record
      - Vetted specialist network for larger engagements
      - Personal accountability on every project

  - objection: "Why not just hire an agency?"
    category: Agency Comparison
    response: >
      Agencies staff projects with whoever's available. You meet seniors in the
      pitch, then get handed off to juniors. We're the opposite—the people you
      talk to are the people who do the work. And we build products (Conduit,
      STUDIO) that agencies themselves use when they hit technical ceilings.
    proof_points:
      - No bait-and-switch staffing model
      - Direct access to 15+ year practitioners
      - Products used by agencies for complex work
      - We're who agencies call when they're stuck

  - objection: "What if you're busy with other clients?"
    category: Availability
    response: >
      We're selective about engagements specifically so we can deliver. We don't
      overcommit. When we take on a project, it gets the attention it deserves.
      If timing doesn't work, we'll tell you upfront rather than spread ourselves
      thin and underdeliver.
    proof_points:
      - Selective engagement model
      - Transparent capacity communication
      - Quality over volume approach
      - Long-term client relationships

  - objection: "How do we know you won't just disappear?"
    category: Continuity
    response: >
      We're building a company, not freelancing between gigs. Conduit and STUDIO
      are long-term product investments. Our advisory relationships span years,
      not months. We have skin in the game—our reputation is tied to every
      engagement we take on.
    proof_points:
      - Product company with long-term roadmap
      - Multi-year client relationships
      - Reputation-based business model
      - Documented knowledge transfer practices

  # === Conduit Product ===

  - objection: "We already have CMS APIs—why do we need Conduit?"
    category: CMS Integration
    response: >
      Native CMS APIs are fragmented and inconsistent across platforms.
      Conduit provides a unified interface, enterprise-grade governance, and
      auditable access across multiple CMS systems. You get one contract for
      content operations, not a pile of custom integrations.
    proof_points:
      - Unified API across CMS platforms
      - Built-in caching, rate limiting, audit logs
      - Extensible adapter architecture
      - Reduces integration maintenance load

  - objection: "We'll build our own integration layer."
    category: Build vs. Buy
    response: >
      Building a production-grade integration layer takes months and becomes
      a permanent maintenance burden. Conduit gives you a stable core now,
      with open-box adapters you can extend. Or hire us to build the pieces
      you need.
    proof_points:
      - Open-box architecture for customization
      - Documented extension points
      - Advisory available for custom implementations
      - Focus your team on domain-specific work

  # === STUDIO Product ===

  - objection: "We already use Copilot/ChatGPT for code generation."
    category: Competition
    response: >
      Consumer AI tools generate code without verification. STUDIO adds
      the traceability and correctness layer that enterprise systems require.
      AI builds the code—STUDIO ensures it's correct. It's the difference
      between prompt-and-pray and Deterministic Orchestration.
    proof_points:
      - Requirements-to-implementation traceability
      - Plan-first workflow prevents architectural drift
      - Deterministic rollback capabilities
      - Built by practitioners who use it daily

  - objection: "How is this different from other AI dev tools?"
    category: Differentiation
    response: >
      Most AI tools focus on generation speed. STUDIO focuses on correctness.
      We trace every change to its requirement, enforce quality gates, and
      provide deterministic rollback. Generation without verification is
      technical debt at scale.
    proof_points:
      - Plan-then-build workflow
      - Quality gates before execution
      - Full audit trail
      - Built by enterprise practitioners, not startup engineers

positioning_against:

  - competitor: "Traditional Agencies"
    our_advantage: >
      Direct access to senior practitioners. No bait-and-switch. The people
      you meet are the people who do the work. Plus we build products agencies
      themselves use.
    their_strength: >
      Established processes, larger teams for sustained capacity, familiar
      engagement models.
    counter: >
      Process without expertise is just organized mediocrity. We offer the
      expertise agencies can't retain.

  - competitor: "Consumer AI Tools (Copilot, ChatGPT)"
    our_advantage: >
      Verification and traceability. Consumer tools generate without
      validating correctness or maintaining audit trails.
    their_strength: >
      Ubiquitous, low barrier to entry, familiar interface.
    counter: >
      Familiarity without correctness creates technical debt at scale.
      STUDIO supervises AI—it doesn't replace human judgment.

  - competitor: "Point CMS Integrations"
    our_advantage: >
      Unified API and enterprise governance across multiple CMS platforms.
    their_strength: >
      Deep platform-specific features.
    counter: >
      Platform depth without cross-system consistency creates integration sprawl.
      Conduit gives you one contract across systems, with extensible adapters.

  - competitor: "Big Consulting Firms"
    our_advantage: >
      Senior practitioners do the work, not junior consultants following
      playbooks. We build products, not just recommendations.
    their_strength: >
      Brand recognition, global scale, comprehensive service offerings.
    counter: >
      You're paying for the brand, not the expertise. The senior partner
      you met disappears after the sale.
