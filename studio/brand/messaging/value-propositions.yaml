    deterministic delivery (STUDIO).

value_hierarchy:
  level_1:
    name: Senior-Level Expertise
    description: >
      The people you talk to are the people who do the work.
      No juniors. No bait-and-switch. No account managers.

      One connection to every CMS. A single interface for content
      operations, governance, and AI context.

      While others do "prompt-and-pray," we build AI systems
      that follow strict architectural logic. No black boxes.

  - name: Products + Advisory
    description: >
      We don't just consult—we build. Our products (Conduit, STUDIO)
