value_hierarchy:
  level_1:
    name: Correctness
    description: >
      Every system we build prioritizes correctness over speed.
      AI-generated code is validated, traced, and auditable.

  level_2:
    name: Traceability
    description: >
      Full visibility from requirement to implementation.
      Every change can be traced to its origin.

  level_3:
    name: Stability
    description: >
      Production-grade reliability. Deterministic behavior.
      Systems that perform predictably under load.

  level_4:
    name: Throughput
    description: >
      High-performance engineering without sacrificing correctness.
      Optimized for enterprise scale.

differentiators:
  - name: Open-Box Architecture
    description: >
      Unlike black-box AI tools, our systems expose their internals.
      Inspect, audit, and customize at every layer.

  - name: Research-First R&D
    description: >
      We focus on advancing the state of the art, not just shipping features.
      Our products emerge from genuine research.

  - name: Industrial-Grade Standards
    description: >
      Built for enterprise environments with high reliability requirements.
      No consumer-grade assumptions.
