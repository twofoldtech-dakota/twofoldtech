    question: "Who are the founders of Twofold Tech?"
    category: Company
    answer: >
      Twofold Tech was founded by Dakota and Dillon Smith—two brothers with
      30 combined years in enterprise software. Dakota is a Senior Architect
      specializing in systems architecture, AI/agentic orchestration, and
      high-performance tooling. Dillon is a Strategic Technology Leader with
      expertise in engineering leadership, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise
      scale operations. The name "Twofold" reflects both the dual nature of
      our approach (expertise + products) and our founding partnership.

  - id: why-not-agency
    question: "Why aren't you an agency?"
    category: Company
    answer: >
      Agencies staff projects with whoever's available—you meet seniors in
      the pitch, then get handed off to juniors. We're the opposite. The people
      you talk to are the people who do the work. We don't carry a bench of
      resources waiting to be billable. We build products (STUDIO, ALLOY) that
      encode our expertise, and we engage directly on advisory and complex
      technical work. We're who agencies call when they're stuck.

  - id: can-two-people-handle-enterprise
    question: "Can two people really handle enterprise projects?"
    category: Company
    answer: >
      We've each spent 15+ years delivering enterprise projects at Fortune 500
      and federal government scale. When engagements require additional capacity,
      we bring in vetted specialists we've worked with for years—but we stay
      accountable. You're not hiring a bench; you're hiring senior expertise
      that scales to fit the work. The question isn't team size—it's whether
      the people doing the work actually know what they're doing.

  - id: how-do-you-scale
    question: "How do you scale for larger engagements?"
    category: Company
    answer: >
      We call it "Scale Without the Bench." For larger engagements, we bring
      in vetted specialists we've worked with for years—people whose work we
      trust. But unlike an agency, we stay personally accountable. Dakota and
      Dillon lead every engagement. We scale to fit the work, not the other
      way around.

  - id: ai-development-approach
    question: "What's your approach to AI-assisted development?"
    category: Company
    answer: >
      We call it Deterministic Orchestration, in contrast to "prompt-and-pray."
      While the industry races toward AI-generated code with no guardrails,
      we focus on ensuring agentic intelligence follows strict, senior-level
      architectural logic. AI should be traceable, auditable, and architecturally
      sound. STUDIO is the product embodiment of this philosophy—plan-first
      workflows, quality gates, requirements traceability, and deterministic
      rollback.

  # === STUDIO Product ===

  - id: studio-architecture
    question: "What is the core architectural philosophy behind STUDIO?"
    category: STUDIO
    answer: >
      STUDIO is built on the principle of Deterministic Orchestration. While
      standard LLMs operate on probabilistic guesses, STUDIO enforces a
      "Plan-First" state machine. It utilizes a Tri-Agent Architecture
      (Planner, Builder, Writer) where every proposed code change must pass
      through validation before execution. This ensures that agentic coding
      remains within the bounds of senior-level architectural constraints.

  - id: studio-cicd
    question: "Is STUDIO compatible with existing CI/CD pipelines?"
    category: STUDIO
    answer: >
      Yes. STUDIO is designed as a portable orchestration layer that plugs
      into the Claude Code CLI environment. It utilizes standard Git-based
      snapshots for its rollback system and can be configured to trigger
      existing enterprise quality gates (Unit Tests, Linting, Security Scans)
      as part of its internal "Quality Gate" lifecycle.

  # === ALLOY Product ===

  - id: alloy-rust
    question: "Why was ALLOY developed in Rust instead of C#/.NET?"
    category: ALLOY
    answer: >
      Our work on large-scale Sitecore migrations (20+ site nodes) identified
      a critical bottleneck in memory management and thread-safe concurrency
      within standard serialization utilities. We engineered ALLOY in Rust to
      leverage its zero-cost abstractions and high-concurrency model. This
      allows for sub-second parsing of complex dependency trees that would
      typically cause memory pressure or silent failures in managed environments.

  # === Advisory Services ===

  - id: architectural-hardening
    question: "How does Twofold Tech define 'Architectural Hardening'?"
    category: Advisory
    answer: >
      Hardening is the process of eliminating latent technical debt within
      legacy .NET and Sitecore XP/XM environments. This involves decoupling
      business logic from the CMS core, optimizing SQL/Solr interaction
      layers, and refactoring tightly coupled pipelines into event-driven
      functions. Hardening the monolith is a prerequisite for a stable,
      high-performance transition to XM Cloud or other modern architectures.

      - decoupling
      - event-driven

  - id: platform-agnostic
    question: "Can your expertise be applied to non-Sitecore ecosystems?"
    category: Company
    answer: >
      While our deep-stack expertise focuses on Sitecore and .NET, the
      underlying orchestration logic of STUDIO is platform-agnostic. Our
      advisory services apply to any complex enterprise environment where
      architecture, AI integration, or engineering leadership guidance is
      needed. The patterns and practices we've developed over 30 combined
      years translate across technology stacks.
