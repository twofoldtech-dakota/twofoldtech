  # === Company & Founders ===

    question: "Who are the founders of Twofold Tech?"
    category: Company
    answer: >
      Twofold Tech was founded by Dakota and Dillon Smith—two brothers with
      30 combined years in enterprise software. Dakota is a Senior Architect
      specializing in systems architecture, AI/agentic orchestration, and
      high-performance tooling. Dillon is a Strategic Technology Leader with
      expertise in engineering leadership, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise
      scale operations. The name "Twofold" reflects both the dual nature of
      our approach (expertise + products) and our founding partnership.

  - id: why-not-agency
    question: "Why aren't you an agency?"
    category: Company
    answer: >
      Agencies staff projects with whoever's available—you meet seniors in
      the pitch, then get handed off to juniors. We're the opposite. The people
      you talk to are the people who do the work. We don't carry a bench of
      resources waiting to be billable. We build products (Conduit, STUDIO) that
      encode our expertise, and we engage directly on advisory and complex
      technical work. We're who agencies call when they're stuck.

  - id: can-two-people-handle-enterprise
    question: "Can two people really handle enterprise projects?"
    category: Company
    answer: >
      We've each spent 15+ years delivering enterprise projects at Fortune 500
      and federal government scale. When engagements require additional capacity,
      we bring in vetted specialists we've worked with for years—but we stay
      accountable. You're not hiring a bench; you're hiring senior expertise
      that scales to fit the work. The question isn't team size—it's whether
      the people doing the work actually know what they're doing.

  - id: ai-development-approach
    question: "What's your approach to AI-assisted development?"
    category: Company
    answer: >
      We call it Deterministic Orchestration, in contrast to "prompt-and-pray."
      While the industry races toward AI-generated code with no guardrails,
      we focus on ensuring agentic intelligence follows strict, senior-level
      architectural logic. AI should be traceable, auditable, and architecturally
      sound. STUDIO is the product embodiment of this philosophy—plan-first
      workflows, quality gates, requirements traceability, and deterministic
      rollback.

  # === Conduit Product ===

  - id: conduit-what-is-it
    question: "What is Conduit?"
    category: Conduit
    answer: >
      Conduit is an enterprise-grade MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that
      provides unified access to multiple CMS platforms through a single
      interface. Connect your assistants and applications to Sitecore XP,
      XM Cloud, Umbraco, Optimizely, Contentful, and more—without building
      one-off integrations.

      - CMS
      - Sitecore
      - unified API

  - id: conduit-why
    question: "Why not just use native CMS APIs?"
    category: Conduit
    answer: >
      Native CMS APIs are fragmented and inconsistent across platforms. Conduit
      gives you one contract for content operations, with enterprise governance
      baked in: caching, rate limiting, and audit logging. You get consistency
      across systems without maintaining a pile of custom integrations.

  # === STUDIO Product ===

  - id: studio-architecture
    question: "What is the core architectural philosophy behind STUDIO?"
    category: STUDIO
    answer: >
      STUDIO is built on the principle of Deterministic Orchestration. While
      standard LLMs operate on probabilistic guesses, STUDIO enforces a
      "Plan-First" state machine. It utilizes a Tri-Agent Architecture
      (Planner, Builder, Reviewer) where every proposed change must pass
      through validation before execution.

      - Deterministic Orchestration
      - Plan-First
      - Tri-Agent Architecture
      - Planner
      - Builder
      - Reviewer

  - id: studio-open-source
    question: "Is STUDIO open source?"
    category: STUDIO
    answer: >
      Yes. STUDIO is open source, with an open-box architecture you can inspect,
      extend, and adapt. We provide advisory for teams that want deterministic
      orchestration without building the system alone.

      - STUDIO
      - open source
      - open-box

  # === Advisory Services ===

  - id: cms-modernization
    question: "Can you help with CMS modernization beyond Sitecore?"
    category: Advisory
    answer: >
      Yes. While we have deep Sitecore expertise, our advisory services apply to
      any enterprise environment where architecture, CMS integration, or AI
      orchestration is needed. Conduit is designed to be platform-agnostic.
