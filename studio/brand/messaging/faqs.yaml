    question: "What is the core architectural philosophy behind STUDIO?"
    category: STUDIO
    answer: >
      STUDIO is built on the principle of Deterministic Orchestration. While
      standard LLMs operate on probabilistic guesses, STUDIO enforces a
      "Plan-First" state machine. It utilizes a Tri-Agent Architecture
      (Planner, Builder, Writer) where every proposed code change must pass
      through a secondary validation agent before execution. This ensures
      that agentic coding remains within the bounds of senior-level
      architectural constraints.

  - id: alloy-rust
    question: "Why was ALLOY developed in Rust instead of C#/.NET?"
    category: ALLOY
    answer: >
      Our research into large-scale Sitecore migrations (20+ site nodes)
      identified a critical bottleneck in memory management and thread-safe
      concurrency within standard serialization utilities. We engineered
      ALLOY in Rust to leverage its zero-cost abstractions and high-concurrency
      model. This allows for sub-second parsing of complex dependency trees
      that would typically cause memory pressure or silent failures in
      managed environments.

  - id: architectural-hardening
    question: "How does Twofold Tech define 'Architectural Hardening'?"
    category: Advisory
    answer: >
      Hardening is the process of eliminating latent technical debt within
      legacy .NET and Sitecore XP/XM environments. This involves decoupling
      business logic from the CMS core, optimizing SQL/Solr interaction
      layers, and refactoring tightly coupled pipelines into event-driven
      functions. Our research proves that hardening the monolith is a
      prerequisite for a stable, high-performance transition to XM Cloud.

  - id: studio-cicd
    question: "Is STUDIO compatible with existing CI/CD pipelines?"
    category: STUDIO
    answer: >
      Yes. STUDIO is designed as a portable orchestration layer that plugs
      into the Claude Code CLI environment. It utilizes standard Git-based
      snapshots for its rollback system and can be configured to trigger
      existing enterprise quality gates (Unit Tests, Linting, Security Scans)
      as part of its internal "Quality Gate" lifecycle.

      - quality gates

  - id: platform-agnostic
    question: "Can Twofold's research be applied to non-Sitecore ecosystems?"
    category: Company
    answer: >
      While our current deep-stack research focuses on Sitecore and .NET,
      the underlying orchestration logic of STUDIO is platform-agnostic.
      It is engineered to bring "Industrial Clarity" to any complex
      enterprise environment where the gap between AI-generated code and
      production-ready architecture needs to be closed.
